Market Failures and Public Policy
Prize Lecture, December 8, 2014
by Jean Tirole
Toulouse School of Economics, France.

This lecture is dedicated to the memory of Jean-Jacques Laffont. It is of course unlike
any lecture I had ever given. It is filled with emotion, intellectual indebtedness and very fond memories. The lecture is also very unfair to the community of researchers who have
developed industrial organization economics in its modern form. The lecture indeed is
in no way a survey, even on its very limited subset of topics, and does not attempt to recognize
contributions. Its purpose rather is to use examples drawn from my own research
to illustrate the approach and use of theoretical industrial organization. This should however
not obscure the fact that modern industrial organization is the outcome of a collective
undertaking by a (still vibrant) community of talented researchers.
